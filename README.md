# TextGame
A web application I would be interested in creating is some sort of strategy or choice-based text game with a database component and an interface component. 
Some ideas I have for a web application include some basic text-based strategy games that utilize a database of predetermined routes and dialog options based on the user's choice, while simultaneously implementing a functional interface.
I would also like to try to make a visual novel text game that uses a database for key frames and facial expressions. 
Expanding on that idea, another type of visual novel game I would be interested in creating that would also feature a similarly structured database, but also features GUI interface for a in-game cell phone for "texting and calling" characters.
